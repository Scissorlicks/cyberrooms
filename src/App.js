							Once different mint goals have been reached, there will be various
							giveaways to holders and donations to a charity of the communityâ€™s
							choice. These giveaways include ETH, Cyber Rooms NFT giveaways and

							In Spring of 2022 we plan to release a VR game where you can
							connect your wallet and view your CyberRoom in VR! In the later
							months of 2022 we plan to revamp the base VR game into a more
							interactive / more objective based game. More information in the
							discord.

						<p>
							Overall we want to have multiple companion drops over the span of
							the next few years to establish an entire house. What we mean by
							that is eventually adding other components such as living rooms,
							backyards, house fronts, bathrooms etc, kind of like building
							blocks to create your own virtual home with CyberRooms NFT. In
							conclusion our end goal is, our holders will be able to have their
							own virtual home that can be explored in VR. We want to build a
							long lasting community by giving back as much as we can. More
							information in the discord.
