								We are the first official room NFT project in the metaverse!

								Ethereum Blockchain Every single item within the room has
								different variants and colors. We are looking to make an NFT
								like no other and make a long lasting community. We want holders
								to feel like Cyber Rooms are just like any other room in their
								home.

						<RoadmapTile title='Game Development'>
							<p>
								In Spring of 2022 we plan to release a VR game where you can
								connect your wallet and view your CyberRoom in VR! In the later
								months of 2022 we plan to revamp the base VR game into a more
								interactive / more objective based game. More information in the
								discord.
							</p>

						<RoadmapTile title='Long Term Goal'>
							<p>
								Overall we want to have multiple companion drops over the span
								of the next few years to establish an entire house. What we mean
								by that is eventually adding other components such as living
								rooms, backyards, house fronts, bathrooms etc, kind of like
								building blocks to create your own virtual home with CyberRooms
								NFT. In conclusion our end goal is, our holders will be able to
								have their own virtual home that can be explored in VR. We want
								to build a long lasting community by giving back as much as we
								can. More information in the discord.
